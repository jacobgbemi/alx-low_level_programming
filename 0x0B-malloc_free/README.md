# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

In this project, I leaned that ```malloc``` function is used to allocate a certain amount of memory during the execution of a program, and ```free``` function is used to clear this memory when no longer in use. I applied these two functions in the tasks below. My function prototypes are saved in [holberton.h](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/holberton.h).

## Tasks

### 0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
- [0-create_array.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/0-create_array.c) - a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.

### 1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings
- [1-strdup.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/1-strdup.c) - a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

### 2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life
- [2-str_concat.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/2-str_concat.c) - a function that concatenates two strings.

### 3. If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize
- [3-alloc_grid.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/3-alloc_grid.c) - a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

### 4. It's not bragging if you can back it up
- [4-free_grid.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/4-free_grid.c) - a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your ```alloc_grid``` function.

### 5. It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe
- [100-argstostr.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/100-argstostr.c) - a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.

### 6. I will show you how great I am
- [101-strtow.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0B-malloc_free/101-strtow.c) - a function that splits a string into words.
