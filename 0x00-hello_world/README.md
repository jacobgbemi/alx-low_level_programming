# 0x00-hello_world

In this project, I started by learning a brief history of C, learned the fundamental of C. I also learned how to use ```gcc```, ```printf```, ```puts```, ```putchar```, ```sizeof```, and how to write code in ```betty-style```.

### 0. Preprocessor
- [0-preprocessor](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor) - A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
  - The C file name will be saved in the variable ```$CFILE```

### 1. Compiler
- [1-compiler](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler) - A script that compiles a C file but does not link.
