# 0x00-hello_world

In this project, I started by learning a brief history of C, learned the fundamental of C. I also learned how to use ```gcc```, ```printf```, ```puts```, ```putchar```, ```sizeof```, and how to write code in ```betty-style```.

### 0. Preprocessor
- [0-preprocessor](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor) - A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
  - The C file name will be saved in the variable ```$CFILE```

### 1. Compiler
- [1-compiler](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler) - A script that compiles a C file but does not link.
  - The C file name will be saved in the variable ```$CFILE```

### 2. Assembler
- [2-assembler](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler) - A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

### 3. Name
- [3-name](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/3-name) - a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named ```cisfun```

### 4. Hello, puts
- [4-puts.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c) - A C program that prints exactly ```"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle```, followed by a new line.

### 5. Hello, printf
- [5-printf.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c) - A C program that prints exactly ```with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,```, followed by a new line.

### 6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation
- [6-size.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c) - A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on
  - Installed the package libc6-dev-i386 on Linux to test the -m32 gcc option

### 7. Intel
- [100-intel](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/100-intel) - A script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file

### 8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity
- [101-quote.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c) -a C program that prints exactly ```and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19```, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
