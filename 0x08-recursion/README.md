# 0x08. C - Recursion

In this project, I learned the meaning of recursion, when to implement recursion amd how to use it.
Note: All the function prototypes are in [main.h](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/main.h)

## Tasks

### 0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget
- [0-puts_recursion.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/0-puts_recursion.c) - a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

### 1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together
- [1-print_rev_recursion.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/1-print_rev_recursion.c) - a function that prints a string in reverse.

### 2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange
- [2-strlen_recursion.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/2-strlen_recursion.c) - a function that returns the length of a string.

### 3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling
- [3-factorial.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/3-factorial.c) - a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

### 4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate
- [4-pow_recursion.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/4-pow_recursion.c) - a function that returns the value of ```x``` raised to the power of ```y```.

### 5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer
- [5-sqrt_recursion.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/5-sqrt_recursion.c) - a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

### 6. Inception. Is it possible?
- [6-is_prime_number.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/6-is_prime_number.c) - a function that returns ```1``` if the input integer is a ```prime number```, otherwise return ```0```.

### 7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything
- [100-is_palindrome.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/100-is_palindrome.c) - a function that returns ```1``` if a string is a palindrome and ```0``` if not.

### 8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...
- [101-wildcmp.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-recursion/101-wildcmp.c) - a function that compares two strings and returns ```1``` if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return ```0```
