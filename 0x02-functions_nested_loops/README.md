# 0x02-functions_nested_loops

In this project, I learned how to use Nested while loops, for loops, and C - Functions. I also learned how to use ```header file``` in C, by creating a [main.h](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/main.h) where I kept all prototype functions.

### 0. _putchar
- [0-putchar.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/0-putchar.c) - a program that prints ```_putchar```, followed by a new line.

  - You can only use ```_putchar``` twice in your code

### 2. 10 x alphabet

### 4. isalpha
- [4-isalpha.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/4-isalpha.c) - a function that checks for alphabetic character.

### 5. Sign
- [5-sign.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/5-sign.c) - a function that prints the sign of a number.

### 6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you
- [6-abs.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/6-abs.c) - a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

### 7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
- [7-print_last_digit.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/7-print_last_digit.c) -  a function that prints the last digit of a number.

### 8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life
- [8-24_hours.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/8-24_hours.c) - a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

### 9. Learn your times table
- [9-times_table.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/9-times_table.c) - a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

### 10. a + b
- [10-add.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/10-add.c) - a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

### 11. 98 Battery Street, the OG
- [11-print_to_98.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/11-print_to_98.c) - a function that prints all natural numbers from ```n``` to ```98```, followed by a new line.

### 12. The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself
- [100-times_table.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/100-times_table.c) - a function that prints the ```n``` times table, starting with 0.

### 13. Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women
- [101-natural.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/101-natural.c) - a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.

### 14. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students.
- [102-fibonacci.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/102-fibonacci.c) - a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with ```1``` and ```2```, followed by a new line.

### 15. Even Liber Abbaci

###  In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+
-[104-fibonacci.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/104-fibonacci.c) - a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with ```1``` and ```2```, followed by a new line.
