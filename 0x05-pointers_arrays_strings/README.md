# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

In this project, I learned how arrays, pointers and strings are used in C, and how they related to computer memory allocation. I used header file, [main.h](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/main.h) to keep all  function prototypes.

## Tasks

### 0. 98 Battery st.
- [0-reset_to_98.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/0-reset_to_98.c) -  a function that takes a pointer to an ```int``` as parameter and updates the value it points to to ```98```.

### 1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream
- [1-swap.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/1-swap.c) - a function that swaps the values of two integers.

### 2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read
- [2-strlen.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strlen.c) - a function that returns the length of a string.

### 3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them
- [3-puts.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/3-puts.c) - a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to ```stdout```.

### 4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear
- [4-print_rev.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/4-print_rev.c) - a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

### 5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes
- [5-rev_string.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/5-rev_string.c) - a function that reverses a string.

### 6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true
- [6-puts2.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/6-puts2.c) - a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

### 7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half
- [7-puts_half.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/7-puts_half.c) -  a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

### 8. Arrays are not pointers
- [8-print_array.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/8-print_array.c) - a function that prints ```n``` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

### 9. strcpy
-[9-strcpy.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/9-strcpy.c) - a function that copies the string pointed to by ```src```, including the terminating null byte (```\0```), to the buffer pointed to by ```dest```.

### 10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers
- [100-atoi.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/100-atoi.c) - a function that convert a string to an integer.

### 11. Don't hate the hacker, hate the code
- [101-keygen.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/101-keygen.c) - a program that generates random valid passwords.
