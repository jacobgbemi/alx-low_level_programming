# 0x06 - More pointers, arrays and strings

This project covers further exercises on pointers, arrays and strings. The prototype functions are placed in [main.h](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/main.h).

## Tasks

### 0. strcat
- [0-strcat.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/0-strcat.c) - a function that concatenates two strings

### 1. strncat
- [1-strncat.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/1-strncat.c) - a function that concatenates two strings but considers ```n``` bytes

### 2. strncpy
- [2-strncpy.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strncpy.c) - a function that copies a string.

### 3. strcmp
- [3-strcmp.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/3-strcmp.c) - a function that compares two strings.

### 4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy
- [4-rev_array.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/4-rev_array.c) - a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

### 5. Always look up
- [5-string_toupper.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/5-string_toupper.c) - a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

### 6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes
- [6-cap_string.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/6-cap_string.c) - a function that capitalizes all words of a string.

### 7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody
- [7-leet.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/7-leet.c) - a function that encodes a string into ```1337```.

### 8. rot13
- [100-rot13.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/100-rot13.c) - a function that encodes a string using ```rot13```

### 9. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper
- [101-print_number.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/101-print_number.c) - a function that prints an integer.

### 10. A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work
- [102-magic.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/102-magic.c) - Add one line to this ```code below```, so that the program prints ```a[2] = 98```, followed by a new line.
- ```#include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
      int n;
      int a[5];
      int *p;

      a[2] = 1024;
      p = &n;
      /*
       * write your line of code here...
       * Remember:
       * - you are not allowed to use a
       * - you are not allowed to modify p
       * - only one statement
       * - you are not allowed to code anything else than this line of code
       */
      ;
      /* ...so that this prints 98\n */
      printf("a[2] = %d\n", a[2]);
      return (0);
    }
    ```


### 11. It is the addition of strangeness to beauty that constitutes the romantic character in art
- [103-infinite_add.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/103-infinite_add.c) - a function that adds two numbers.

### 12. Noise is a buffer, more effective than cubicles or booth walls
- [104-print_buffer.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/104-print_buffer.c) - a function that prints a buffer.
