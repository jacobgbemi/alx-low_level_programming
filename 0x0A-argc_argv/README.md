# 0x0A. C - argc, argv

In this project, I learned about the two prototypes of ```main```, the use of argument counter, ```argc``` and argument vector (array), ```argv```, and how arguments are passed to a program.

## Tasks

### 0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to
- [0-whatsmyname.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-argc_argv/0-whatsmyname.c) - a program that prints its name, followed by a new line.

### 1. Silence is argument carried out by other means
- [1-args.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-argc_argv/1-args.c) - a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.

### 2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter
- [2-args.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-argc_argv/2-args.c) - a program that prints all arguments it receives.

### 3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument
- [3-mul.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-argc_argv/3-mul.c) - a program that multiplies two numbers.

### 4. To infinity and beyond
- [4-add.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-argc_argv/4-add.c) - a program that adds positive numbers.

### 5. Minimal Number of Coins for Change
- [100-change.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-argc_argv/100-change.c) - a program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money.
