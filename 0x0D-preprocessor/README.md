# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

In this project, I learned about macros and how to use them, the most common predefined macros, and how to include guard your header files.

## Tasks
### 0. Object-like Macro
- [0-object_like_macro.h](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/0-object_like_macro.h) - a header file that defines a macro named ```SIZE``` as an abbreviation for the token ```1024```

### 1. Pi
- [1-pi.h](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/1-pi.h) - a header file that defines a macro named ```PI``` as an abbreviation for the token ```3.14159265359```.

### 2. File name
- [2-main.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/2-main.c) - a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.

### 3. Function-like macro
- [3-function_like_macro.h](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/3-function_like_macro.h) - a function-like macro ```ABS(x)``` that computes the absolute value of a number ```x```.

### 4. SUM
- [4-sum.h](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/4-sum.h) - a function-like macro ```SUM(x, y)``` that computes the sum of the numbers ```x``` and ```y```.
