# Low Level Programming & Algorithm

This repository contains programs written for Low Level Programming track in the [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/) program. In these projects, I worked through virtual machine (Vagrant) using Linux terminal to write basic C codes, starting with understanding data types, variables, input and output commands, operators, if-else statements, looping, functions and neseted loops . I learned how to apply these knowledge to solve practical problems.

### Acknowledgement
All works in the project were completed in regard to ALX online program (Cohort 6). The program offered a peer-learning platform where the participants undergo a rigorous project-based coding exercises, and learn by interacting with one another. More info is here: [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/)
