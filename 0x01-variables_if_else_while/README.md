# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

In this project, I learned about comments”, “Data types | Integer types”, “Declaration”, “Characters”, “Arithmetic operators”, “Variables assignments”, “Comparisons”, “Logical operators”, “if, if…else”, “while loops” and "for loops". 

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
- [0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c) - a C program that assign a random number to the variable ```n``` each time it is executed. Completed the [source code](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/rrqNDWjrCWdARnWFLPExPw) in order to print whether the number stored in the variable ```n``` is positive or negative. 

### 1. The last digit
- [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c) - a C program that assign a random number to the variable ```n``` each time it is executed. Complete the [source code](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/5HWhPDsq3jq1yCRQFrLl4Q) in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable ```n```

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
- [2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c) - a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
  - You can only use the ```putchar``` function and only use it twice

### 3. alphABET
- [3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c) - a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
  - You can only use the ```putchar``` function and only use it thrice

### 4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
- [4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c) - a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase except ```e``` and ```q```, followed by a new line.
  - You can only use the ```putchar``` function and only use it twice

### 5. Numbers
- [5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c) - a C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line

### 6. Numberz
- [6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c) - a C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
  - You can only use the ```putchar``` function and only use it twice

### 7. Smile in the mirror
- [7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c) - a C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
  - You can only use the ```putchar``` function and only use it twice

### 8. Hexadecimal
- [8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c) - a C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
  - You can only use the ```putchar``` function and only use it thrice

### 9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success
- [9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c) -  a C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
  - You can only use the ```putchar``` function and only use it four times

### 10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
- [100-print_comb3.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c) - a C program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
  - You can only use the ```putchar``` function and only use it five times

### 11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...
- [12. Software is eating the World](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c) - a C program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
  - You can only use the ```putchar``` function and only use it six times

### 12. Software is eating the World
- [102-print_comb5.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/102-print_comb5.c) - a C program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
  - You can only use the ```putchar``` function and only use it eight times
