# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

In this project, I did more tasks on Nested while loops, Nested for loops, and C - Functions. I also used header file in C, by creating a [main.h](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/main.h) where I put all prototype functions.

## **Tasks**

### 0. isupper
- [0-isupper.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/0-isupper.c) -  a function that checks for uppercase character.

### 1. isdigit
- [1-isdigit.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/1-isdigit.c) - a function that checks for a digit (```0``` through ```9```).

### 2. Collaboration is multiplication
- [2-mul.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/2-mul.c) - a function that multiplies two integers.

### 3. The numbers speak for themselves
- [3-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/3-print_numbers.c) - a function that prints the numbers, from ```0``` to ```9```, followed by a new line.
  - You can only use ```_putchar``` twice in your code

### 4. I believe in numbers and signs
- [4-print_most_numbers.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/4-print_most_numbers.c) - a function that prints the numbers, from ```0``` to ```9``` except ```2``` and ```4```, followed by a new line.
  - You can only use ```_putchar``` twice in your code

### 5. Numbers constitute the only universal language
- [5-more_numbers.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/5-more_numbers.c) - a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from ```0``` to ```14```, followed by a new line.
  - You can only use ```_putchar``` thrice in your code

### 6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line
- [6-print_line.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/6-print_line.c) - a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

### 7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe
- [7-print_diagonal.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/7-print_diagonal.c) - a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

### 8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch
- [8-print_square.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/8-print_square.c) - a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

### 9. Fizz-Buzz
- [9-fizz_buzz.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/9-fizz_buzz.c) - Write a program that prints the numbers from ```1``` to ```100```, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print ```Fizz``` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print ```Buzz```. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print ```FizzBuzz```.

### 10. Triangles
- [10-print_triangle.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/10-print_triangle.c) - a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

### 11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic
- [100-prime_factor.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/100-prime_factor.c) - a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number ```612852475143```, followed by a new line.

### 12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper
- [101-print_number.c](https://github.com/jacobgbemi/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/101-print_number.c) - a function that prints an integer.
  - only use ```_putchar```
  - ```long``` is not allowed
  - arrays or pointers are not allowed
  - hard-code special values is not allowed
